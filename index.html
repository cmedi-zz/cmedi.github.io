    <h1>TOWARD ETERNITY</h1>
    <pre class=poem>
    A poem is not always
    genitals
    blood
    violence
    sexism
    homophobia
    trauma
    goofy
    sometimes the poem is held
    in my grandfather’s hairy arms
    he is back
    the poem loves him again
    he left the cheese
    on the bottom cabinet
    of the fridge for me
    he feels still alive
    when I’m kind
    or not entirely myself
    but another self
    much better 
    like an ideal to aspire
    save for the baldness
    he can keep that for himself
    Other times 
    the poem is three years old
    reaching for the cheese
    lying on its aunt’s stomach
    all poems have stomachs
    poem's stomachs growl
    when something rhymes
    she breathes deeply
    the cadence
    throws the poem into sleep
    tightly
    other times the poem's mother
    forgets to hurt the poem's
    strange sexuality
    all poems are born with inclinations
    the poem's mother is not inclined
    to ask intimate questions
    for which the poem does not have answers
    sometimes they are back at the beach
    where the poem had a childhood
    the poem is nine years old
    almost old enough to know
    he is running out of stanzas or lines soon
    the mother asks the poem
    "What do you want to celebrate this decade?"
    the poem does not know for sure
    the poem feels that growing old is getting
    the things that you want
    for itself, because growing
    old is the things that you want
